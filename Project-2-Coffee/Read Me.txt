    Everett Enterprises is a marketing agency for major social media companies.
They currently host their business in a on-premises data center, but have decided
to move to the cloud due to the financial and performance improvements. They have
a website that is utilized by their clients, and it is urgent that they have a 
working environment for their business requirements.  

    You have been hired to assist their company with the transition. You must 
design a fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solution to replace their 
on-premises infrastructure.  

    For this project, you will build a 3-tier web architecture in AWS. This 
architecture will consist of a public tier to load balance traffic to the private
tiers. Private tiers will consist of the web-servers hosting the application and
a backend database tier that is fully managed and highly available. 

*All infrastructure will be created using Terraform*
